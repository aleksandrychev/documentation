The CFEngine Enterprise API allows HTTP clients to interact with the
CFEngine Enterprise  *Hub*.  Typically this is also the policy server.

![Enterprise API Overview](enterprise-api-architecture-overview.png)

The Enterprise API is a REST API, but a central part of interacting with the
API uses SQL. With the simplicity of REST and the flexibility of
SQL, users can craft custom reports about systems of arbitrary scale, mining
a wealth of data residing on globally distributed CFEngine Database Servers.
