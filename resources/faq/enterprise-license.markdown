To get a license please open a [support request](https://support.northern.tech)
including the number of hosts you would like each hub to be licensed for with
the archive generated by running `tar --create --gzip --directory /var/cfengine
--file $(hostname)-ppkeys.tar.gz ppkeys/localhost.pub` on each hub.

## License installation instructions

First ensure there is no `license.dat` `/var/cfengine/masterfiles` or
`/var/cfengine/inputs`.

Install the license using `cf-key`.

```console
cf-key --install-license license.dat
```

**Note:** If you get an error complaining about an existing license simply move
it out of the way.

The new license should take effect automatically in about 5 minutes.

To have the license take effect immediately re-start `cf-hub`.

```console
systemctl restart cf-hub
```

or

```console
service /etc/init.d/cfengine3 restart
```

You can check the license information in the Mission Portal About page (top
right) or by querying the API.

```console
curl --cacert /var/cfengine/httpd/ssl/certs/$(hostname -f).cert --silent https://$(hostname -f)/api/settings --user admin
```
