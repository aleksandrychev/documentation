[%CFEngine_function_prototype(regex, list)%]

**Description:** Return whether any element of `list` matches the
[Unanchored][unanchored] regular expression `regex`.

[This function can accept many types of data parameters.][Functions#collecting functions]

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(regex, list)%]

`some()` will return as soon as any element matches.

It's convenient to set a class to `not => some(".*", mylist)` in order
to check if `mylist` is empty. Since `some()` returns as soon as
possible, that is better than using `length()` or `every()` or
`none()` which must traverse the entire list.

**Example:**

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(some.cf, #\+begin_src cfengine3, .*end_src)%]

Output:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(some.cf, #\+begin_src\s+example_output\s*, .*end_src)%]

**History:** The [collecting function][Functions#collecting functions] behavior was added in 3.9.

**See also:** [About collecting functions][Functions#collecting functions], `filter()`, `every()`, and `none()`.
