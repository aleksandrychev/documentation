[%CFEngine_function_prototype(filename, regex, groupsize)%]

**Description:** Returns the current host's partition peers (excluding it).

So given `groupsize` 3 and the file

```
a
b
c
# this is a comment d
e
```

The peers of host `b` will be `a` and `c`.

Given a list of host names in `filename`, one per line, and excluding
comment lines starting with the [unanchored][unanchored] regular
expression `regex`, CFEngine partitions the host list into groups of
up to `groupsize`. Each group's peer leader is the first host in the
group.

The `comment` field is a multiline regular expression and will strip out
unwanted patterns from the file being read, leaving unstripped characters to be
split into fields. Using the empty string (`""`) indicates no comments.

The current host (unqualified or fully qualified) should belong to
this file if it is expected to interact with the others. The function
returns an empty list otherwise.

[%CFEngine_function_attributes(filename, regex, groupsize)%]

`groupsize` must be between 2 and 64 to avoid nonsensical promises.

**Example:**

Prepare:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(peers.cf, #\+begin_src prep, .*end_src)%]

Run:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(peers.cf, #\+begin_src cfengine3, .*end_src)%]

Output:

[%CFEngine_include_snippet(peers.cf, #\+begin_src\s+example_output\s*, .*end_src)%]
